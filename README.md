# photoGalleryApp

This is a full stack application where users can upload images and then view them in the dashboard of the website. Used NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB for creating the entire backend architecture and used AWS S3 bucket for storing the images in cloud. Used ReactJS and Redux for creating the entire frontend architecture. 

The application was also hosted on AWS EC2 instance.

But right now it is not hosted because the usage of the platform went out of the normal free usage capacity of AWS and because of that I was also charged.

In both client and server folder you will find a .env.example file where the explanation of all the details of the different env variables will be mentioned. Please make sure you provide those entries in the .env file before starting the project.

Before starting the projects please make sure you have NodeJS installed in your system

Then please follow the below steps in your terminal

First go inside the server folder through your terminal

```
cd server
npm start
```
Keep the script running in that terminal and open another terminal and navigate to the client folder of the project

```
cd client
npm start
```
And the application will start running on http://localhost:3000
